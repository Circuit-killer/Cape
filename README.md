Cape 3.0
====
Cape implements a new, private key, public salt, xor based, symmetric stream cipher along with a pseudo-random initialization vector asymmetric encryption algorithm, both originally developed to offer data security on limited microcontrollers.

Cape is an experimental project, should be used for research and educational purposes and should not be applied in production. Cape 3.0 has been posted on reddit/r/crypto to obtain feedback about its algorithm and great minds broke it in a matter of hours:
- rspencer01 exposed a full break of the algorithm using brute force and some hints about its plaintext
- silkeh exposed a known plaintext attack and poor performance of salt
See the extremely educational related [issue](https://github.com/gioblu/Cape/issues/17) and the [KnownPlainTextVulnerability example](https://github.com/gioblu/Cape/blob/master/examples/KnownPlainTextVulnerability/KnownPlainTextVulnerability.ino)

If you would like to support us developing a new, more secure algorithm, feel free to tell us your thoughts opening an issue.

### How to use Cape
Instantiate Cape passing the encryption key, its length and optionally the salt. The longer is the key the higher is the encryption strength. Encryption key must be kept secret and never transmitted, generated salt instead can be exchanged only if encrypted.
```cpp  
  // Instance name - Private key - Length
  Cape cape("YOUR-ENCRYPTION-KEY", 19);
  // Optional Public salt (to be shared encrypted)
  cape.salt = "S";                      
```
Adding salt higher data security, supporting the same private key usage for a longer time, exchanging a new salt once in a while if necessary.
To hash data call `hash` passing the data source buffer, the destination buffer and the data length:
```cpp  
  char source[] = "CRYPTMEPLEASE";
  char destination[13];
  // Light symmetric stream cipher -> "I1C_8K)*8G}dB"
  cape.hash(source, destination, 13);    
  // Hash again to get back        -> "CRYPTMEPLEASE"
  cape.hash(destination, source, 13);   
```
To encrypt a string call `encrypt` passing the data source buffer, the destination buffer, the data length and a pseudo-random 8-bit integer used as initialization vector:
```cpp  
  char source[] ="CRYPTMEPLEASE";
  char destination[14];
  // Strong asymmetric encryption  -> "09)*&{!@#*)I)"
  cape.encrypt(source, destination, 13, random(0, 255));
  // Call decrypt to get back      -> "CRYPTMEPLEASE"
  cape.decrypt(destination, source, 14);
```
In the destination buffer it is saved the encrypted data along with a one byte initialization vector at the end, be sure to define your destination buffer always 1 byte longer and not to exceed 65534 data length.

If you need to change the encryption key after instantiation call `set_key` passing the new key and its length:
```cpp  
  cape.set_key("YOUR-ENCRYPTION-KEY", 19);
```
### Encryption strength
To better understand the encryption strength provided by each method and configuration see the table below:
```cpp
 ____________________________________
| Function | Key | Salt     | Str.   |
|__________|_____|__________|________|
|          |     |          | STRONG |
| Encrypt  | LTD | variable | 8      |
| Encrypt  | STD | variable | 7      |
| Encrypt  | LTD | fixed    | 6      |
| Encrypt  | STD | fixed    | 5      |
|----------|-----|--------=-|--------|
| Hash     | LTD | variable | 4      |
| Hash     | STD | variable | 3      |
| Hash     | LTD | fixed    | 2      |
| Hash     | STD | fixed    | 1      |
|          |     |          | WEAK   |
|__________|_____|__________|________|
```
* `STD`: using key Shorter Than Data
* `LTD`: using key Longer Than Data
